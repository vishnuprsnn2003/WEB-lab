Vegetables are the edible parts of herbaceous plants, such as leaves, stems, roots, tubers, bulbs, and flowers, which provide essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants to humans. They are low in calories and high in water, but rich in nutrients and play a crucial role in a balanced diet by boosting the immune system and reducing the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. While the culinary and botanical definitions differ, with some "vegetables" like tomatoes being botanical fruits, the common understanding is that they are savory, earthy plant matter, not sweet fruits, nuts, or grains.
