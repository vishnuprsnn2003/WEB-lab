Fruits are the seed-bearing, ripened ovaries of flowering plants, botanically defined as any plant structure enclosing seeds, including items often considered vegetables like tomatoes and avocados. In culinary terms, they are typically sweet, fleshy, edible plant products, but can also be dry, like nuts. Fruits are vital for human diets, providing essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water, while also serving to protect and disperse seeds.
