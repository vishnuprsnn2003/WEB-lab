Flowers are the colorful, often fragrant, reproductive parts of flowering plants (angiosperms) that produce seeds for new plants. They have a universal function in reproduction but come in a vast array of forms, colors, and sizes, ranging from the small blossoms of an aster to the impressive blooms of a Rafflesia. Flowers have distinct parts, including sepals for support, petals to attract pollinators, and male stamens and female gynoecium for producing and receiving pollen.
