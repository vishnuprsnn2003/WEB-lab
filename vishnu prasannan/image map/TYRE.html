Car tires are essential, ring-shaped rubber components that provide the sole contact point between the vehicle and the road, enabling safety, control, and comfort. They are made from a mixture of natural and synthetic rubber, fabric, wire, and chemical fillers, and are manufactured by shaping and curing this compound under heat and pressure. Key functions of tires include supporting the vehicle's weight through air pressure, providing traction for acceleration, braking, and steering, and absorbing road vibrations to enhance the ride and support the suspension system. Maintaining proper tire pressure, regular checks for wear and damage, and choosing the correct tire size and type for your vehicle are crucial for safety, performance, and longevity.
