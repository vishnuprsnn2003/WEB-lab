Car windows are made from two types of safety glass: laminated glass for the windshield and tempered glass for the side and rear windows. Laminated glass, with its plastic interlayer, is designed to hold together upon impact, protecting against penetration and ejection, while tempered glass is a single, heat-strengthened pane that breaks into small, rounded pieces for occupant safety.
