Front glass, or a windshield, is a car's front window made of laminated safety glass that protects occupants from wind, debris, and UV radiation, provides structural integrity, and supports airbags in a crash. It's a crucial safety component, and if it's cracked or damaged, it must be repaired or replaced to maintain the vehicle's structural strength and prevent ejection from the car in an accident.
