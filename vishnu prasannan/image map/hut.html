<p>A hut is a simple, small dwelling or shelter, often temporary, built from readily available, natural materials like wood, grass, mud, or stone. While sometimes used as a permanent home by indigenous or nomadic cultures, huts are generally considered less durable than a house but more complex than a basic shelter like a tent. They are characterized by their simple construction, often with one or two rooms, providing protection from the elements for people like campers, hikers, and villagers.
