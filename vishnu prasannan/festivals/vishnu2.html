<p>Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/), also called Deepavali (IAST: Dīpāvalī) or Deepawali (IAST: Dīpāwalī),[4] is the Hindu festival of lights, with variations celebrated in other Indian religions such as Jainism and Sikhism.[a] It symbolises the spiritual victory of Dharma over Adharma, light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.[5][6][7][8] Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kārtika—between around mid-September and mid-November.[9][10][11][12][13] The celebrations generally last five or six days.[14][15]

Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana.[16] It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles.[17] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. </p>
<h2>Holi</h2>

</a>
<p>Holi (IPA: ['hoːli:, hoːɭiː]) is a major Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love and Spring.[1][7][8][9] It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.[10][11] Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil,[12][13] as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu.[14][15] Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian diaspora.[8][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]

Holi also celebrates the arrival of spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love.[16][23] It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[16][23] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. </p>
<h2>Onam</h2>
<a href="onam.html"target="_blank">
<img src="onam.jpeg" alt="Onam" style="width:500px;height:700px;">
</a>
<p>Onam (IPA: [oːɳɐm]) is an annual harvest and cultural festival[4][5] celebrated mostly by the people of Kerala and is traditionally associated with the legend of the benevolent Asura King Mahabali, who once ruled Kerala, returning each year to visit his people.[6][7][8] A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state[7][9] and includes a spectrum of cultural events.[10][11][7][12] Although rooted in Hindu mythology, it is harmoniously celebrated by people of all communities in Kerala.

In 1961, during the tenure of Chief Minister Pattom Thanu Pillai, Onam was officially declared the national festival of Kerala. However, in the following year, large-scale celebrations were curtailed due to the Indo–China War. Despite this interruption, the government’s declaration marked a turning point, and from then onwards Onam gradually developed into a grand public festival celebrated across the state and among the Malayali diaspora.</p>
