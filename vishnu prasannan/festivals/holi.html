<img src="holi.jpg" style="width:500px;height:700px;"alt="Holi">
<p>Holi is an ancient Hindu festival that marks the arrival of spring and celebrates the victory of good over evil and love over hate. Also known as the "Festival of Colors," it is celebrated with great joy by throwing colored powder and water on each other, singing, dancing, and feasting. The festival's origins are rooted in stories of the triumph of Prahlad over his demon king father, Hiranyakashyap, and the love between Radha and Krishna.  </p>
